# Release v1.0.4 - Manifest Fix

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fix

### Fixed
- âœ… **Extension loading error** - Removed reference to missing `popup.html` file
- âœ… **Manifest.json cleanup** - Extension now loads without errors
- âœ… **Ready to reload** - Extension can be properly reloaded in Chrome

### What Changed
The manifest.json referenced a `default_popup: popup.html` file that didn't exist, causing extension loading failures. Since Heads Up uses the side panel interface, the popup action was unnecessary and has been removed.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Included

- **Fixed manifest.json** - No more missing file references
- **Extension files** - All core functionality with real-time coaching
- **sample-config.json** - Ready-to-import coaching scenarios

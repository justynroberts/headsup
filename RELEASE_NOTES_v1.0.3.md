# Release v1.0.3 - True Real-Time Coaching

## 🚀 Major Improvement: Instant Coaching Hints

### Fixed
- ✅ **REAL-TIME COACHING** - Hints now appear immediately as you speak!
- ✅ **No more delay** - Coaching analysis now happens on interim results (gray text)
- ✅ **Instant feedback** - Keywords trigger coaching hints while words are still being recognized

### What Changed
Previously, coaching hints only appeared after speech recognition finalized segments (when gray text became black). This created a noticeable delay.

Now, coaching analysis runs on **both**:
- **Interim results** (gray text as you speak) ← NEW!
- **Final results** (black text when finalized)

This means you get coaching hints **the moment** relevant keywords are detected, not after a delay.

## 📦 What's Included

- **Extension files** - Updated with real-time coaching
- **sample-config.json** - 5 coaching scenarios that trigger instantly:
  - "price" → Value/ROI coaching
  - "competitor" → Differentiation response  
  - "timeline" → Closing opportunity
  - "technical" → Implementation support
  - "boss/manager" → Authority check guidance

## 🚀 Installation

1. Download `headsup-extension-v1.0.3.zip`
2. Extract to a folder
3. Open Chrome → Extensions → Enable Developer Mode
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder

## ⚡ Experience the Difference

With v1.0.3, say "That's expensive" and watch the coaching hint appear **instantly** as you speak, not after you finish talking!
